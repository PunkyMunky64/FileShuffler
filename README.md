A program that randomly shuffles files with the same file extension! 
Good for experiments.

CAREFUL: THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS. DO NOT TRUST OR RELY ON IT. THERE ARE NO CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES IN THIS PROGRAM, 
BUT COULD HAVE ERRORS THAT COULD RESULT IN DATA LOSS. IT DELETES FILES IN A NONRIGOROUS PROGRAM ENVIRONMENT. WITHOUT CONFIRMING, 
OR WITH UNEXPECTED INPUT, THIS PROGRAM CAN IRREVERSIBLY DELETE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA.

Not polished.
