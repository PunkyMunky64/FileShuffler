A program that randomly shuffles files with the same file extension... I needed a couple of times, somehow

CAREFUL: THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS. DO NOT TRUST OR RELY ON IT. THERE ARE NO CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES IN THIS PROGRAM, 
BUT COULD HAVE ERRORS THAT COULD RESULT IN DATA LOSS. IT DELETES FILES IN AN OPEN PROGRAM ENVIRONMENT. WITHOUT CONFIRMATION, 
OR WITH UNEXPECTED INPUT, THIS PROGRAM CAN IRREVERSIBLY DELETE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA.

Not polished.
